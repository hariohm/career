Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) describes how software applications are built. It usually contains the following phases:
Requirements gathering
Analysis of the requirements to guide design
Design of new features based on the requirements
Development of new capabilities (writing code to meet requirements)
Testing and verification of new capabilities—confirming that they do indeed meet the requirements
Deployment of the new project
Agile Development:  advocates for splitting up large monolithic releases into multiple mini-releases, 
each done in two- or three-week-long sprints, and uses automation to build and verify applications. 
 agile development often focuses on releasing new functionality multiple times a day, building software incrementally instead of all at once.

Secure SDLC’s aim is not to completely eliminate traditional security checks, such as penetration tests,
but rather to include security in the scope of developer responsibilities and empower them to build secure applications from the outset.
