Zeek (formerly Bro) is a powerful open-source network monitoring and intrusion detection system that generates detailed logs about network traffic.
Zeek logs contain valuable information about network activity, which can be analyzed to detect anomalies, threats, and trends.
Zeek generates various logs, each focused on a specific type of network activity. The most common logs include:

Conn.log
Purpose: Records all network connections.
Key Fields:
id.orig_h / id.resp_h: Source and destination IP addresses.
id.orig_p / id.resp_p: Source and destination ports.
proto: Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).
service: Detected service (e.g., HTTP, DNS).
duration: Connection duration.
missed_bytes: Bytes missed during capture.
Use Case: Baseline network activity, identify unusual connections, detect large volumes of data transfer.

b. Dns.log
Purpose: Records DNS query activity.
Key Fields:
query: The queried domain.
qtype_name: Query type (e.g., A, AAAA).
answers: Returned IP addresses.
rcode_name: Response code (e.g., NXDOMAIN for nonexistent domains).
Use Case: Detect suspicious DNS requests, domain generation algorithms (DGA), or tunneling.

Http.log
Purpose: Records HTTP traffic details.
Key Fields:
host: Hostname of the request.
uri: Requested URI.
method: HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
status_code: HTTP response status code.
Use Case: Identify unusual HTTP traffic, detect malware callbacks, analyze browsing activity.
