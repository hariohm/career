Linux event logs are placed into four categories: application logs, event logs, service logs, and system logs.
Users can find all the logs of a Linux system by running the following command on the terminal:
ls /var/log = Logs in this directory include details about system activity, user activity, kernel messages, and application errors.
 /var/log/auth.log (or /var/log/secure) = Contains: Login attempts (successful and failed), sudo activity, SSH login attempts, PAM authentication logs, and other security-related information.
/var/log/syslog =  Logs related to system services, system start-up and shutdown events, general information, and error messages.
 Monitor for system malfunctions, unexpected shutdowns, or unauthorized service starts.
/var/log/kern.log = Contains: Messages generated by the kernel, including hardware errors, kernel panic logs, or events triggered by drivers and system modules.
 /var/log/dmesg= Kernel ring buffer logs that capture messages related to system startup, hardware initialization, and device driver activity.
Use for SOC Analysts: Identify suspicious devices, changes in hardware configuration, or kernel exploits.
/var/log/faillog
Purpose: Failed login attempts.
Contains: Failed login attempts for all users.
Use for SOC Analysts: Detect brute-force attacks and account lockout events.
/var/log/utmp and /var/log/wtmp
Purpose: User login/logout information.
Contains: utmp stores information about current user logins, and wtmp records a history of all logins.
Use for SOC Analysts: Track user activity, session time, and abnormal logouts.

Modern Linux systems now store the actual password hash in a separate file (/etc/shadow),
while /etc/passwd contains an "x" or "!" in the password field, indicating the password hash is stored elsewhere.
Only root or privileged users can access these password-related files:
/etc/passwd (readable by all users)
/etc/shadow (only readable by root or privileged users)
/etc/gshadow (only readable by root or privileged users)

/bin = which stores binary files
/sbin = contains system binaries that are required for system administration
/etc = This directory contains system-wide configuration files and directories that control the behavior of the operating system and installed software.
Examples: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/network/, /etc/ssh/
This directory is crucial for understanding user configurations, monitoring for unauthorized changes, and ensuring security settings are properly configured.
/var/log/: Contains logs for various system processes and applications.
Monitoring logs in /var/log is essential for detecting security events such as failed login attempts, system crashes, and unauthorized access.
/tmp =  Malicious actors may place temporary files in this directory to execute scripts or other malicious actions without leaving traces in more permanent locations. 
It's important to monitor and clean this directory.
/lib and /lib64
Purpose: Contains essential shared libraries (similar to DLLs in Windows) that the binaries in /bin and /sbin depend on to execute.
SOC analysts should monitor these directories to detect any tampering with critical system libraries that might enable privilege escalation or malware execution.
usr/bin/, /usr/lib/, /usr/share/
SOC Relevance: This directory may contain installed software that can be used to investigate whether software or services running on the system are legitimate or compromised.
/dev
Purpose: Contains device files that represent hardware devices, such as hard drives, USB devices, and input/output devices.
Monitoring for unauthorized device activity or detecting rootkits that modify device files is a critical task for SOC analysts.
/proc
Purpose: A virtual filesystem that contains information about running processes, system resources, and kernel parameters.
Examples: /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/[PID]/status
SOC Relevance: SOC analysts use this directory to inspect the current state of running processes. It is useful for identifying suspicious processes, memory usage, and system status.
